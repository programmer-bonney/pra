      <h1>Short History</h1><br/>
        <p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberia after the 14 years of civil conflict is undergoing serous developmental engagement. As a result, I felt that we all need to contribute to that developmental engagement. However, the idea of Liberia Market 2 Day  came to mind in 2015 and I started making research on how i can sell products for people online for a fair price and thats ecommerce by the way. This idea never ceased to leave my mind, until I started developing the real world for  my ideas applications and findings. I am Dominic Bonney, founder of Liberia Shop 2Day. </p>
